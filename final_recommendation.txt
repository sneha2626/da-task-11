If p-value < 0.05
The A/B test results show that users exposed to advertisements have a statistically significant higher conversion rate compared to the PSA group.
At a 95% confidence level, the null hypothesis is rejected.
It is recommended to roll out the advertisement strategy.

If p-value ≥ 0.05
Although the advertisement group shows a slightly higher conversion rate, the difference is not statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.
Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
It is recommended not to roll out the advertisement strategy and to conduct further testing.
